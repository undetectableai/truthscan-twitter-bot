# Task ID: 3
# Title: Configure Cloudflare Worker Route for Detection Pages
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up Cloudflare Worker routing for /detect/:id URLs.
# Details:
Configure a route in the Cloudflare Dashboard for /detect/:id that maps to a Worker. Use Cloudflare Workers' routing capabilities to handle GET requests only[1][2][5]. Example route: /detect/*. Ensure the Worker is not proxied to the dashboard app.

# Test Strategy:
Test route configuration by accessing /detect/test-id and verifying the Worker responds. Check logs for correct routing.
