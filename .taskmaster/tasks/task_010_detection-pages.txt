# Task ID: 10
# Title: Optimize Performance and Caching
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Configure edge and browser caching for detection pages.
# Details:
Set Cloudflare edge cache to 24 hours and browser cache to 1 hour. Use Cloudflare Workers' cache API for popular pages. Example:

const cache = caches.default;
await cache.put(request, response);

# Test Strategy:
Test cache headers and verify caching behavior. Measure page load times under load.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Configuring Edge Cache [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up and customize edge cache policies, including defining cache TTL, cache size, and rules for which content is cached at the edge.
### Details:
This involves configuring the edge cache settings in your CDN or edge platform, such as setting the maximum TTL, specifying which URIs or content types to cache, and adjusting cache size limits as needed.

## 2. Setting Browser Cache Headers [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Configure HTTP response headers to control browser-side caching behavior, such as Cache-Control and Expires headers.
### Details:
Set appropriate Cache-Control headers (e.g., max-age, must-revalidate) to instruct browsers how long to cache content, ensuring alignment with edge cache policies.

## 3. Implementing Cache API Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.2
### Description: Develop or update application logic to interact with cache APIs for purging, updating, or bypassing cache as needed.
### Details:
Implement logic to programmatically purge or refresh cached content when updates occur, and ensure cache API integration supports business requirements for content freshness.

## 4. Testing Cache Behavior [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.3
### Description: Verify that edge and browser caches behave as expected under various scenarios, including cache hits, misses, purges, and content updates.
### Details:
Perform functional tests to ensure cache rules are applied correctly, content is served from cache when appropriate, and updates are reflected after purges.

## 5. Measuring Performance Under Load [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.4
### Description: Conduct load testing to evaluate the impact of caching on performance, latency, and resource utilization.
### Details:
Use load testing tools to simulate high-traffic scenarios, measure cache hit ratios, response times, and identify any bottlenecks or areas for optimization.
