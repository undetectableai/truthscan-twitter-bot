# Task ID: 7
# Title: Frontend: Dashboard Basic Setup (React, Vite, Tailwind, Routing)
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Set up the basic structure for the React dashboard using Vite, including TailwindCSS for styling and react-router-dom for routing.
# Details:
1. In `packages/dashboard`, ensure Vite, React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and `react-router-dom` are installed. 
2. Configure TailwindCSS: Initialize `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js`. Include Tailwind directives in `src/index.css`. 
   `tailwind.config.js` content: `content: ["./index.html", "./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}"], theme: { extend: {} }, plugins: []` 
3. Set up basic routing in `src/App.tsx` using `react-router-dom`. Create a route for `/dashboard` that renders a placeholder `DashboardPage` component. 
4. Create a simple layout component (e.g., `Layout.tsx`) with a header/sidebar placeholder. 
5. Ensure the Vite dev server (`pnpm dev`) runs and displays the basic dashboard page.

# Test Strategy:
Run `pnpm dev` in `packages/dashboard`. Verify the dashboard page loads at the correct route (e.g., `/` or `/dashboard`). Check that TailwindCSS utility classes can be applied and take effect. Basic navigation should work if multiple routes are stubbed.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Initialize the Dashboard Project with Vite and React [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up a new React project using Vite for fast development. This includes creating the project directory, installing dependencies, and running the initial development server.
### Details:
Run `npm create vite@latest react-analytics-dashboard --template react`, navigate into the directory, install dependencies with `npm install`, and start the dev server with `npm run dev`.[2]

## 2. Configure TailwindCSS [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Install and configure TailwindCSS for styling the dashboard. This involves installing TailwindCSS and updating the configuration files.
### Details:
Install TailwindCSS with `npm install tailwindcss`, initialize the config, and update the main CSS file to include Tailwind's directives.[2]

## 3. Set Up Routing with React Router [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.2
### Description: Install and configure React Router to enable navigation between dashboard pages.
### Details:
Install `react-router-dom` and set up basic routes in `App.jsx` for pages like Dashboard and Analytics.[2]

## 4. Create Basic Layout Components (Header and Sidebar) [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.3
### Description: Develop the foundational layout components such as Header and Sidebar, and integrate them into the main layout.
### Details:
Create `Header.jsx` and `Sidebar.jsx` in the components folder with basic TailwindCSS styling, and use them in the main layout to structure the dashboard.[2]
