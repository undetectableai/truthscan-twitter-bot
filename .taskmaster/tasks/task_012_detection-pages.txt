# Task ID: 12
# Title: Implement Monitoring and Dashboard Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8, 9
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add monitoring for errors, performance, and integrate analytics into the admin dashboard.
# Details:
Log 404s, database errors, and image loading failures. Display page statistics (views, top pages) in the admin dashboard. Use Cloudflare Workers' logging and D1 for storage. Example:

console.log(`Error loading image: ${imageUrl}`);

# Test Strategy:
Test error logging and dashboard integration. Verify statistics are accurate and up-to-date.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Logging Errors and Events [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement mechanisms to capture and log errors and significant events from the application in real time, ensuring all relevant actions and issues are recorded for monitoring purposes.
### Details:
Set up event listeners and error handlers in the backend to capture events such as user actions, system errors, and other significant occurrences. Ensure logs are structured and timestamped for later analysis.

## 2. Storing Logs and Statistics [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Design and implement a storage solution for logs and statistical data, enabling efficient retrieval and real-time analytics.
### Details:
Choose an appropriate storage backend (e.g., columnar database, time-series database) optimized for real-time ingestion and querying. Ensure logs and statistics are stored in a way that supports fast aggregation and retrieval for dashboard use.

## 3. Integrating Analytics into the Dashboard [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.2
### Description: Connect the backend analytics and statistics to the dashboard frontend, enabling real-time data flow and updates.
### Details:
Expose APIs or data endpoints that the dashboard can poll or subscribe to for real-time updates. Integrate these endpoints into the dashboard application using appropriate frontend frameworks and visualization libraries.

## 4. Displaying Statistics [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.3
### Description: Develop and refine the dashboard UI to clearly and accurately present real-time statistics and logs to users.
### Details:
Use visualization components (e.g., charts, tables, graphs) to display key metrics and logs. Ensure the UI updates dynamically as new data arrives and is easy to interpret for end users.

## 5. Validating Monitoring Accuracy [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.4
### Description: Implement processes to verify the accuracy and reliability of the monitoring and analytics system, ensuring data integrity and correct dashboard representation.
### Details:
Set up automated tests and manual validation procedures to compare logged events and displayed statistics against known benchmarks or simulated data. Address discrepancies and refine the system as needed.
