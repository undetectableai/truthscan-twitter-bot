# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement Image Handling and Thumbnail Strategy
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Handle image display, caching, and thumbnail generation for Open Graph.
# Details:
Link directly to Twitter CDN for images. If unavailable, use cached copies in Cloudflare R2. Generate thumbnails for Open Graph previews. Example pseudo-code:

const imageUrl = detection.image_url || await getCachedImage(detection.id);
const thumbnail = await generateThumbnail(imageUrl);

# Test Strategy:
Test image loading from Twitter CDN and R2 fallback. Verify thumbnail generation and Open Graph image display.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Linking to Twitter CDN Images [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Establish logic to retrieve and serve images directly from the Twitter CDN, ensuring correct URL formatting and access permissions.
### Details:
Implement code to construct and validate Twitter CDN image URLs, handle authentication if required, and ensure images are accessible for downstream processing.

## 2. Implementing R2 Fallback Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Develop fallback logic to retrieve images from R2 storage if the Twitter CDN image is unavailable or fails to load.
### Details:
Monitor image loading from the Twitter CDN and, upon failure, automatically attempt to fetch the image from R2 storage, ensuring seamless user experience.

## 3. Generating Thumbnails [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.2
### Description: Create a process to generate optimized thumbnails from the original images, supporting various sizes and formats as needed.
### Details:
Implement image processing routines to resize, crop, and compress images for thumbnail generation, ensuring performance and quality balance.

## 4. Integrating Thumbnails with Open Graph [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.3
### Description: Integrate the generated thumbnails into Open Graph metadata to enhance link previews on social platforms.
### Details:
Update page metadata to reference the correct thumbnail URLs in Open Graph tags, ensuring compatibility with major social networks.

## 5. Testing Image Loading and Fallback [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.4
### Description: Thoroughly test the image loading pipeline, including CDN access, R2 fallback, thumbnail generation, and Open Graph integration.
### Details:
Develop and execute test cases covering successful and failed CDN loads, fallback scenarios, thumbnail correctness, and Open Graph preview rendering.
