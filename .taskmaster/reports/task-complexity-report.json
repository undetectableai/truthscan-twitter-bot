			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Project Setup: Monorepo, TypeScript, and Base Configurations",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the project setup into subtasks for initializing the pnpm monorepo, configuring workspace files, setting up TypeScript for both worker and dashboard, installing dependencies, creating configuration files, and consulting Cloudflare best practices.",
			"reasoning": "Setting up a monorepo with pnpm, TypeScript, and base configurations for both backend (Cloudflare Worker) and frontend (React dashboard) involves multiple steps, cross-package coordination, and careful configuration management. It requires knowledge of monorepo tooling, TypeScript setup, and initial project structure, making it moderately complex[1][2][3][4][5]."

			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Cloudflare Worker: Twitter Webhook Endpoint & CRC Validation",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task into subtasks for defining the webhook endpoint, implementing CRC validation logic, handling secrets, logging POST payloads, and testing with Twitter's CRC challenge.",
			"reasoning": "Implementing a secure webhook endpoint with Twitter's CRC validation requires understanding of the Twitter API, cryptographic operations using the Web Crypto API, secure secret handling, and robust endpoint design. The need for both GET and POST handling and integration with Cloudflare Workers adds to the complexity."

			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Cloudflare Worker: Tweet Parsing and Image URL Extraction",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break this task into subtasks for parsing webhook payloads, identifying relevant tweet events, extracting image URLs, and handling edge cases (no images, multiple images).",
			"reasoning": "Parsing JSON payloads and extracting specific data from potentially complex Twitter event structures is moderately complex, especially when handling various edge cases and ensuring robust extraction logic."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Data Storage: Cloudflare D1 Database Schema and Setup",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks for defining the SQL schema, creating the D1 database, configuring wrangler.toml bindings, applying the schema, and verifying connectivity from the worker.",
			"reasoning": "Designing a database schema, setting up Cloudflare D1, configuring bindings, and ensuring proper integration with the worker involves several steps and requires understanding of both SQL and Cloudflare's deployment model."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Cloudflare Worker: AI Detection API Call (Mock) & D1 Storage",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into subtasks for implementing the mock AI detection function, integrating it with image extraction, storing results in D1, handling secrets, and verifying data persistence.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves asynchronous API integration (even if mocked), data processing, and reliable storage in D1, requiring careful error handling and coordination between components."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Cloudflare Worker: Tweet Reply Logic",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks for installing Twitter API client, initializing with secrets, composing reply messages, posting replies, and handling API errors.",
			"reasoning": "Replying to tweets programmatically involves secure API client setup, message formatting, error handling, and integration with previous detection logic, making it moderately complex."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Frontend: Dashboard Basic Setup (React, Vite, Tailwind, Routing)",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into subtasks for initializing the dashboard project, configuring TailwindCSS, setting up routing, and creating basic layout components.",
			"reasoning": "Setting up a modern React dashboard with Vite and TailwindCSS is a standard frontend task, but requires attention to configuration and project structure."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Frontend: Dashboard - Display Recent Detections Table",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks for implementing the API endpoint, fetching data in React, rendering the table, formatting data, and styling with TailwindCSS.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves both backend (API endpoint) and frontend (data fetching, table rendering, formatting) work, requiring coordination and some data transformation."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Frontend: Dashboard - Implement Charts (Recharts)",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into subtasks for installing Recharts, processing detection data, implementing the Pie and Bar charts, and integrating them into the dashboard.",
			"reasoning": "Implementing charts requires data aggregation, component integration, and UI work, but leverages established libraries, keeping complexity moderate."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Security: Secrets Management and Dashboard Protection",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks for identifying secrets, configuring Wrangler secrets, implementing dashboard protection (Cloudflare Access or Basic Auth), documenting the setup, and testing access controls.",
			"reasoning": "Proper secrets management and access control are critical for security, requiring careful configuration, documentation, and testing across both backend and frontend."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 11,
			"taskTitle": "Wrangler Configuration and Deployment Setup",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into subtasks for configuring wrangler.toml for worker and dashboard, setting up deployment scripts, verifying local development, and testing full deployment.",
			"reasoning": "Coordinating deployment for both Cloudflare Worker and Pages from a monorepo, including D1 bindings and secrets, involves multiple configuration files and deployment scenarios, making it moderately complex[1][2][4]."
