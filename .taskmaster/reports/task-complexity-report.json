		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Update Database Schema for Detection Pages",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the schema update into: (1) designing the new detection_pages table, (2) updating the detections table, (3) writing migration scripts, and (4) verifying schema changes with test data.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves straightforward schema changes and basic SQL operations, with moderate complexity due to the need for migration and foreign key management. Testing and validation add some overhead, but the logic is standard for database updates."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Secure Short URL Generation",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: (1) designing the short ID algorithm, (2) implementing secure random generation, (3) filtering out unwanted patterns, (4) storing and validating uniqueness in the database, and (5) collision and pattern testing.",
			"reasoning": "Generating secure, unique, and filtered short URLs requires careful algorithm design, randomness, collision handling, and integration with the database. The need to filter offensive/confusing patterns and ensure uniqueness increases complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Configure Cloudflare Worker Route for Detection Pages",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into: (1) configuring the route in the Cloudflare Dashboard, (2) updating Worker code to handle the route, and (3) verifying routing and logging.",
			"reasoning": "This is a configuration-focused task with minimal logic, mainly involving dashboard setup and basic route handling. Testing is straightforward."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Develop HTML Template for Detection Results Page",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: (1) designing the layout and structure, (2) implementing responsive CSS, (3) adding placeholders for dynamic data, and (4) accessibility and browser testing.",
			"reasoning": "Requires both design and implementation skills, with attention to responsiveness and accessibility. The logic is not complex, but thorough testing is needed for quality."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Page Generation Logic in Cloudflare Worker",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: (1) parsing and validating the URL, (2) querying detection and page data, (3) integrating with the HTML template, (4) handling external resource fetching, (5) error handling, and (6) testing with various scenarios.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves backend logic, data fetching, template rendering, and error handling. It requires careful coordination between components and robust testing, making it one of the more complex tasks."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate Open Graph and SEO Meta Tags",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into: (1) generating dynamic Open Graph tags, (2) adding Twitter and SEO meta tags, (3) implementing JSON-LD structured data, and (4) validating with social and search tools.",
			"reasoning": "Meta tag integration is mostly templating and data mapping, but requires attention to detail and validation with external tools. Complexity is moderate."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Image Handling and Thumbnail Strategy",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: (1) linking to Twitter CDN images, (2) implementing R2 fallback logic, (3) generating thumbnails, (4) integrating thumbnails with Open Graph, and (5) testing image loading and fallback.",
			"reasoning": "Image handling involves external dependencies, fallback logic, and thumbnail generation, each with potential edge cases and performance considerations."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Add Page View Counter and Analytics",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: (1) incrementing view counters, (2) tracking last_viewed timestamps, (3) querying top viewed pages, and (4) validating analytics logic.",
			"reasoning": "Basic analytics and counters are simple to implement, but require careful database updates and validation to ensure accuracy."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Error Handling and Edge Cases",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into: (1) handling 404 errors, (2) handling 410 and deleted detections, (3) handling 500 and database errors, and (4) implementing branded error pages and image placeholders.",
			"reasoning": "Comprehensive error handling covers multiple scenarios and requires branded UI for each, but the logic is well-defined and modular."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Optimize Performance and Caching",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: (1) configuring edge cache, (2) setting browser cache headers, (3) implementing cache API logic, (4) testing cache behavior, and (5) measuring performance under load.",
			"reasoning": "Caching involves both configuration and code changes, with a need for thorough testing to ensure correct behavior and performance improvements."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 11,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate Detection Page URL into Twitter Bot Replies",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: (1) modifying bot reply logic, (2) storing the URL in the database, (3) testing reply formatting, and (4) verifying database updates.",
			"reasoning": "Bot integration is straightforward but requires coordination between backend and external API, with testing for both reply content and data storage."
